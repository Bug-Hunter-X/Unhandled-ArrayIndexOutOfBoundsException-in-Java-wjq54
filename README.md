This repository contains a simple Java program demonstrating an uncommon bug: an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is caught, but the program continues without properly handling the error. This could lead to unexpected behavior or data corruption. The solution demonstrates how to properly handle the exception, either by logging the error or by taking corrective action.
